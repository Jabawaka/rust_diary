# Rust Diary

This was a very simple diary application to track my exercise and weight. It is mostly an exercise in learning and using [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui). It has now expanded to be a diary in which to trak exercise and weight, plot the graphs with them to encourage me to follow it, and a ToDo app on the side for kicks.
